      "The talks of a new stadium for the Kansas City Royals team had been around since September this year when President Dayton Moore departed. The Kansas City Royals team has made it official that it plans to develop a new baseball stadium. • The Royals team's Kauffman Stadium lease ends in 2030. John Sherman, the Royals CEO, stated that the cost of renovations required to the Kauffman Stadium, which would be 60 years old in 2030, would be much higher than the cost of building a new ballpark. • The CEO wrote that a new stadium would be a better investment from the perspective of the local taxpayer dollars being used to support the establishment and the Kansas City community as a whole.",
